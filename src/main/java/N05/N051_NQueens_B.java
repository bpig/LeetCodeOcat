/**
 * The n-queens puzzle is the problem of placing n queens on an n√ón chessboard
 * such that no two queens attack each other.
 * <p>
 * Given an integer n, return all distinct solutions to the n-queens puzzle.
 * <p>
 * Each solution contains a distinct board configuration of the n-queens' placement,
 * where 'Q' and '.' both indicate a queen and an empty space respectively.
 * <p>
 * For example,
 * There exist two distinct solutions to the 4-queens puzzle:
 * <p>
 * [
 * [".Q..",  // Solution 1
 * "...Q",
 * "Q...",
 * "..Q."],
 * <p>
 * ["..Q.",  // Solution 2
 * "Q...",
 * "...Q",
 * ".Q.."]
