/**
 * Given an array of citations (each citation is a non-negative integer) of a researcher,
 * write a function to compute the researcher's h-index.
 * <p/>
 * According to the definition of h-index on Wikipedia:
 * "A scientist has index h if h of his/her N papers have at least h citations each,
 * and the other N âˆ’ h papers have no more than h citations each."
 * <p/>
 * For example, given citations = [3, 0, 6, 1, 5],
 * which means the researcher has 5 papers in total
 * and each of them had received 3, 0, 6, 1, 5 citations respectively.
 * Since the researcher has 3 papers with at least 3 citations each
 * and the remaining two with no more than 3 citations each, his h-index is 3.
 * <p/>
 * Note: If there are several possible values for h, the maximum one is taken as the h-index.
