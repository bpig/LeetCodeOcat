 * If the number of nodes is not a multiple of k then left-out nodes in the end should remain as it is.

 * You may not alter the values in the nodes, only nodes itself may be changed.

 * Only constant memory is allowed.
 * <p/>
 * For example,
 * Given this linked list: 1->2->3->4->5
 * <p/>
 * For k = 2, you should return: 2->1->4->3->5
 * <p/>
 * For k = 3, you should return: 3->2->1->4->5
