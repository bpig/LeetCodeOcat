/**
 * Implement next permutation,
 * which rearranges numbers into the lexicographically next greater permutation of numbers.
 * <p/>
 * If such arrangement is not possible,
 * it must rearrange it as the lowest possible order (ie, sorted in ascending order).
 * <p/>
 * The replacement must be in-place, do not allocate extra memory.
 * <p/>
 * Here are some examples.
 * Inputs are in the left-hand column and its corresponding outputs are in the right-hand column.
 * 1,2,3 -> 1,3,2
 * 3,2,1 -> 1,2,3
 * 1,1,5 -> 1,5,1
